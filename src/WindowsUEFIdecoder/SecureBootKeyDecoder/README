                                 --------

This utility is intended to be used from the UEFI shell prompt on an X86_64 
platform that supports UEFI 2.3.1 Secure Boot or later.  Unless you sign this
utility with an appropriate key, this utility will only work on a platform where 
UEFI Secure Boot is disabled.

Invoke ListCerts -h to view available options.

Valid options include:

     -pk   Display information about the PK
     -kek  Display information about KEKs
     -db   Display information about db keys
     -dbx  Display information about dbx keys

If invoked without an option all keys are displayed.

Most of the certificate parsing code came either directly or was heavily
derived from work by David Howells of Red Hat for the 3.7 kernel 
(see .../crypo/asymmetric_keys, .../include, .../lib, etc.) I simply modified 
the code to work from a UEFI shell, added appropriate OIDs, etc.

Note that the files x509.[hc] only contain a subset of the X509 ASN.1 schema 
- not all of the X509 ASN.1 schema!
